Market & Matching Mechanisms

Problem: current implementation is not very well suited to take network topologies into account as
it expects all agents to be fully connected - each agent has a connection to each other agent.
It keeps track of all offerings in the Transaction object which is therefore the "offer-book" as it
knows all offers and updates.

Thus Matching needs to be done accordingly with neighborhood

Always: In each Sweep shuffle Agents randomly and walk them => each agent once per sweep but in random order

Matchings
	Best Of Neighbours
		-> Select best offerings of all neighbours: each neighbor gives an offering and best will be drawn
	
	Random Neighbour
		-> select random neighbor and try match: random neighbor will give offering
		
	Global Best
		-> store best offers for each market and match only with those AND neighborhood => very slow convergence if not fully connected
